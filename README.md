A sorting visualizer is a tool that graphically represents the process of sorting an array using various sorting algorithms. This helps in understanding how each algorithm works step-by-step. Here is a brief description of the sorting algorithms this visualizer covers:

1. Bubble Sort: Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the array is sorted. It's simple but inefficient for large datasets.

2. Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into its correct position among the previously sorted items.

3. Selection Sort: Divides the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. Repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region.

4. Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array around the pivot, so that elements less than the pivot are on the left, and elements greater than the pivot are on the right. This process is recursively applied to the sub-arrays.
 
5. Merge Sort: Also a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves back together.

This visualizer dynamically shows these processes, making it easier to comprehend the behavior and efficiency of each sorting algorithm.
